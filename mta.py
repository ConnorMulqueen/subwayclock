# Provides a simple interface to train arrival times from the MTA's
# data feeds. A MTA API key is required which must be in the file 'apikey.txt'.
# The interface consists of the getTrainTimes function which takes two
# arguments, the station id's of the uptown and downtown platforms of the
# station we are querying. What will be returned is a 4-tuple which will
# contain:
# 1. A list of the ids of the uptown trains (e.g. "A","1","Q","F", etc.)
# 2. A list of the arrival times of the uptown trains expressed as number
#    of minutes from the current time.
# 3. Same as #1, but for the downtown train
# 4. Same as #2, but for the downtown train
